Introduction:
In the hustle of daily life, every excursion becomes a microcosm of decision-making. In those moments, I find myself habitually reaching for technology to streamline my routes. Nowadays, whenever I go out, I instinctively open my map application on my phone to find out the most efficient course. These navigation apps tell me how to reach my destination in the shortest distance, allowing me to avoid unnecessary hassles. Thanks to the revolutionary advancements in daily navigation, I am able to better manage my time. Therefore, now mapping apps play a pivotal role in my daily routine. My personal experience has led me to ponder the algorithms that work quietly behind the scenes to program the shortest paths.

Fortunately, I was able to learn this kind of algorithm in our Discrete Structures class. Through the learning, I learned Dijkstra’s algorithm. Dijkstra’s algorithm determines the shortest path. It will provide a path that minimizes the overall distance (weight) between the source node and all other nodes in a weighted graph. Therefore, I aimed to delve into the world of Dijkstra's algorithm as it lays the foundation for optimizing everyone’s journeys. A dedicated and curious individual, I have a strong passion for algorithms and their real-world applications. Dijkstra's algorithm represents an exciting challenge, and I am eager to unravel its intricacies and implications.

Thus, I chose Dijkstra’s algorithm as my topic. my focus is on unraveling the complexities of Dijkstra's algorithm and its pivotal role in determining the shortest paths between locations. Titled "Exploring Dijkstra's Algorithm: Unveiling the Shortest Paths," this endeavor is not just an academic pursuit, but a personal exploration born out of the daily reliance on navigation apps that seamlessly guide us through the labyrinth of our routines. The central question guiding this exploration is: "How to find the shortest distance between the current location and the destination on Maps through Dijkstra's Algorithm?"

The scope of my project is comprehensive, aiming to bridge the theoretical and practical aspects of Dijkstra's algorithm. I planned to provide a solid understanding of its theoretical foundations while showcasing its real-world applications, particularly in optimizing transportation routes. The project goes beyond abstraction by incorporating an interactive element, allowing users to define start and stop locations within a large area. NetworkX and matplotlib are strategic choices to facilitate visualization without compromising depth.
  
In the initial phase of this project, I delved into the theoretical underpinnings of Dijkstra's algorithm, translating insights gained into the implementation of a fundamental version within a simulated environment. Moving forward, my strategy involved tapping into the capabilities of built-in functions such as Breadth-First Search (BFS), Depth-First Search (DFS), and Dijkstra's algorithm, thoughtfully integrated through NetworkX. This approach not only facilitates efficient experimentation and algorithmic variations but also promises enhanced visualization. In the final phase, edge highlighting, and node coloring features were added to enhance the project's ability to vividly and insightfully demonstrate Dijkstra's algorithm in action.

This project is not just an academic milestone but a personal exploration into the algorithms shaping my daily choices. Real-world case studies will further enrich my understanding, contributing not only to my knowledge but also to the broader comprehension of a fundamental concept in computer science. Ultimately, this project is a journey to demystify and appreciate the algorithms silently working behind the scenes of our digital lives.

Analysis:
In this final project, I wanted to explore more about my hometown, Shanghai. I decided to collect data from a digital map of Shanghai. The graph was constructed with seven prominent locations as vertices, and distances between these points were calculated, scaled, and assigned as weights to the edges. This process aimed to provide a tangible representation of the spatial relationships between key landmarks in Shanghai.
The resulting graph, with its seven vertices and weighted edges, introduces an element of complexity that mirrors the intricacies of real-world geographical networks. The density of the graph, characterized by the number of vertices and edges, plays a role in shaping the computational complexity of the algorithms applied.

I employed various methods to explore Dijkstra's algorithm and visualize its application in finding the shortest paths between locations. Leveraging the NetworkX and Matplotlib libraries, I implemented functions such as `dijkstra_shortest_path`, `dfs_traversal`, and `bfs_traversal` to compute the shortest path and perform depth-first and breadth-first search traversals, respectively. The project utilized a graph representation of Shanghai's landmarks, incorporating weights to denote distances between locations.

For the visualization aspect, the `visualize_map` function was created to provide a graphical representation of the graph. The nodes represented popular locations in Shanghai, and the edges were weighted to signify the distances between them. The use of different node colors, edge colors, and labels enhanced the clarity of the visualizations, making them more accessible for interpretation.

To illustrate the practical application of Dijkstra's algorithm, the project allowed user input for start and end locations, computing the shortest path and distances accordingly. The visualizations included highlighting the shortest path, edges traversed in DFS, and edges traversed in BFS, providing a dynamic representation of the algorithm in action.

The use of interactive elements and visualizations aligns with the objectives outlined in the project proposal, aiming to enhance user engagement, and understanding. The code demonstrates a systematic approach to implementing algorithms covered in the CS5002 course, particularly focusing on graph theory and algorithms for traversing graphs.

Throughout the analysis, the project maintained a clear connection to the course materials, utilizing concepts from networkx and matplotlib for graph representation and visualization. The incorporation of real-world locations and distances in the graph provided a tangible context for understanding the application of Dijkstra's algorithm in route optimization. The code structure and comments also contribute to the overall clarity of the analysis, making it accessible for further exploration and understanding by others in the field.

The analysis and implementation of Dijkstra's algorithm in my final project have successfully answered the central question: "How to find the shortest distance between your current location and your destination on Maps through Dijkstra's Algorithm?" The process begins by assigning the ending vertex a distance of zero and designating it as the current vertex. Subsequently, the algorithm explores all vertices leading to the current one, calculating their distances to the end by adding the most recent edge's weight. It crucially avoids recording distances that are longer than previously recorded ones, ensuring that only the shortest paths are considered. After this calculation, the current vertex is marked as visited, signaling that it won't be revisited. The algorithm then identifies the next vertex with the smallest distance and designates it as the new current vertex, proceeding to iterate through the previous process until explores and marks all vertices, optimizing the discovery of the shortest paths within the graph.

My project utilized this idea and let the visualizations to help me vividly depicted the shortest path when compared with the routes taken during depth-first and breadth-first search traversals. The project not only provided a hands-on understanding of Dijkstra's algorithm but also showcased its practical applications in route optimization, particularly within the context of a city map.

However, like any project, there are notable weaknesses and limitations. One major limitation is the reliance on a manually constructed graph representing a simplified map of Shanghai. While this approach serves the illustrative purpose, real-world scenarios often involve dynamic and evolving networks. The lack of dynamic data in this project limits its applicability to more complex and realistic situations. 

Additionally, the project assumes accurate user input for start and end locations, overlooking potential 
errors or inaccuracies that may arise in practical applications.Future investigations could address these limitations by incorporating real-time data from mapping APIs to create more dynamic and realistic representations of urban environments. Furthermore, the project could explore additional algorithms for comparison, considering factors such as computational efficiency and accuracy in diverse scenarios. A more extensive user interface could also be developed, allowing users to interact with the map more intuitively and providing real-time feedback during algorithm execution.

From this project, I have learned not only the technical aspects of implementing graph algorithms but also the importance of translating theoretical knowledge into practical applications. The visualizations and hands-on approach have deepened my understanding of algorithms' real-world implications. This experience will undoubtedly be valuable in future courses, especially those involving data structures and algorithms. Moreover, the project has equipped me with skills applicable to future endeavors, where algorithmic problem-solving is a crucial aspect. This report serves as a tangible record of my exploration into Dijkstra's algorithm, providing insights that will undoubtedly guide future projects and learning endeavors.

In conclusion, while the project has its limitations, it has served its primary purpose of exploring and visualizing Dijkstra's algorithm effectively. The weaknesses identified pave the way for future enhancements and refinements, contributing to a continuous learning process. The insights gained from this project, both technical and practical, are invaluable and will undoubtedly influence my future academic and professional pursuits.
